<h1 align="center">✨ Hello everyone, I'm Do Nguyen Thien Phuc</h1>

🏁 I am a a third-year student at the University of Information Technology. My goal is to become a FullStack developer and someday visit Japan.

🐣 I have completed several courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am currently learning the ReactJS framework to enhance my skills. During my third year, I aim to solidify my Front-End knowledge and create a high-quality Front-End project.<br>
🐥 In my fourth year, I plan to spend the first half studying foundational Back-End knowledge, including Ruby, Golang, and Unity. After that, I will work on a Back-End project and integrate it with Front-End to build a complete product.<br>
🐔 Additionally, toward the end of my fourth year, I plan to study AWS and improve my English to elevate my personal skills.<br>
